# Portfolio

## Description
I wanted t build out a portfolio that represents my current work as a software developer. This portfolio will allow future employers to view a sample of my work.

I gained additional experience in structuring a webpage in HTML and CSS designing my portfolio. I gained knowledge about implementing variables, media queries, and flex box.
